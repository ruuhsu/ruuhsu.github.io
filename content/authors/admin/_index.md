      Responsibilities include:
      - Analyzed whole-genome sequencing data from children with Down syndrome (DS) who developed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and compared them with DS controls to assess the impact of single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and structural variants (SVs) on ALL susceptibility and subtypes.
      - Conducted outcome analysis for DS-ALL, evaluating treatment response, infectious toxicity, and survival based on demographic, clinical, and genomic factors.
      - Applied Mendelian randomization to assess birth characteristics' influence (e.g., birth weight) on ALL risk in DS children.

    summary: |
      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.
