  - Children with trisomy 21 (Down syndrome, DS) face a markedly increased risk of developing leukemia, particularly acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (AMKL). This elevated risk does not occur in isolationâ€”many children with DS also have a higher burden of congenital birth defects, and emerging evidence suggests these phenomena are interconnected.
