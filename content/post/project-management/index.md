ðŸ“ˆQ-Q plot is an essential tool for detecting problems (such as unrecognized population structure, analytical approach, genotyping artifacts, etc.) in a Genome-wide association study (GWAS). 

## Introduction

* A Quantile-Quantile (QQ) plot (in general) plots the observed quantiles of one distribution versus another, OR plots the observed quantiles of a distribution versus the quantiles of the ideal distribution.

* In GWAS, we use a QQ plot to plot our the quantile distribution of observed p-values (on the y-axis) versus the quantile distribution of expected p-values. In an ideal situation, where there ARE NO causal polymorphisms, the QQ-plot will be a line. 

* The reason is that we will observe a uniform distribution of p-values from such a case and in our QQ, we are plotting this observed distribution of p-value versus the expected distribution of p-values: a uniform distribution (where both have been -log transformed).

** Note that if your GWAS analysis is correct but you do not have enough power to detect positions of causal polymorphisms, this will also be your result (!!)-> it is a way to assess whether you can detect any hits in your GWAS.

### To plot a QQ-plot

One way to do it is by using the [qqman package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/qqman/vignettes/qqman.html) in R. 

<div class="highlight" style="padding: 1.5rem;">
<pre class="chroma">
<code>
  install.packages('qqman')
  library(qqman)
  qq(result$PVALUE, main = "QQ Plot of {{Project}}")  
</code>
</pre>
</div>

### Lambda (Î»)
When making a QQ-plot, it is important to calculate lambda (also called the genomic inflation factor, often written as Î»GC).

* Î» quantifies how much the observed test statistics deviate from what youâ€™d expect under the null hypothesis (i.e., no association). It helps assess whether your test statistics are inflated due to technical or population structure issues.
* Detect inflations or deflations of P-values

ðŸ“ˆ If your QQ plot shows a systematic upward curve and Î» is >>1 (e.g., 1.2 or higher), it suggests inflation, possibly from:
* Population stratification
* Cryptic relatedness
* Batch effects
* Genotyping errors

ðŸ“ˆ If Î» is <1, it might signal deflation, often due to:
* Overcorrection
* Conservative test statistics
* Sparse data

<div class="highlight" style="padding: 1.5rem;">
<pre class="chroma">
<code>
  chisq <- qchisq(1 - result$PVALUE, df = 1)
  lambda <- median(chisq, na.rm = TRUE) / qchisq(0.5, df = 1)
  legend("topleft", legend = bquote(lambda == .(round(lambda, 3))), bty = "n")
</code>
</pre>
</div>
