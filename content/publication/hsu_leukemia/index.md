abstract: "In essence, this study reports that all B-cell ALL genetic subtypes—not just the previously known CRLF2-rearranged or JAK2-mutated forms—occur at higher incidence in children with Down syndrome. This broadening of scope signals the need to consider every subtype when addressing DS-associated leukemia."

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
# summary: Parkinson's disease (PD) causes motor dysfunction and dopaminergic cell death, with current treatments often leading to side effects. This study demonstrates that pretreating adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) with n-butylidenephthalide (BP), a compound with neuroprotective effects, enhances their therapeutic efficacy in a PD mouse model. Transplantation of BP-pretreated ADSCs improved motor symptoms and restored dopamine neuron levels, highlighting a promising strategy to enhance stem cell therapies for neurodegenerative diseases.
