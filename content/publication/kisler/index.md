abstract: "Background: PICALM is one of the most significant susceptibility factors for Alzheimer's disease (AD). In humans and mice, PICALM is highly expressed in brain endothelium. PICALM endothelial levels are reduced in AD brains. PICALM controls several steps in Aβ transcytosis across the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Its loss from brain endothelium in mice diminishes Aβ clearance at the BBB, which worsens Aβ pathology, but is reversible by endothelial PICALM re-expression. Thus, increasing PICALM at the BBB holds potential to slow down development of Aβ pathology.

Methods: To identify a drug that could increase PICALM expression, we screened a library of 2007 FDA-approved drugs in HEK293t cells expressing luciferase driven by a human PICALM promoter, followed by a secondary mRNA screen in human Eahy926 endothelial cell line. In vivo studies with the lead hit were carried out in Picalm-deficient (Picalm+/-) mice, Picalm+/-; 5XFAD mice and Picalmlox/lox; Cdh5-Cre; 5XFAD mice with endothelial-specific Picalm knockout. We studied PICALM expression at the BBB, Aβ pathology and clearance from brain to blood, cerebral blood flow (CBF) responses, BBB integrity and behavior.

Results: Our screen identified anti-malaria drug artesunate as the lead hit. Artesunate elevated PICALM mRNA and protein levels in Eahy926 endothelial cells and in vivo in brain capillaries of Picalm+/- mice by 2-3-fold. Artesunate treatment (32 mg/kg/day for 2 months) of 3-month old Picalm+/-; 5XFAD mice compared to vehicle increased brain capillary PICALM levels by 2-fold, and reduced Aβ42 and Aβ40 levels and Aβ and thioflavin S-load in the cortex and hippocampus, and vascular Aβ load by 34-51%. Artesunate also increased circulating Aβ42 and Aβ40 levels by 2-fold confirming accelerated Aβ clearance from brain to blood. Consistent with reduced Aβ pathology, treatment of Picalm+/-; 5XFAD mice with artesunate improved CBF responses, BBB integrity and behavior on novel object location and recognition, burrowing and nesting. Endothelial-specific knockout of PICALM abolished all beneficial effects of artesunate in 5XFAD mice indicating that endothelial PICALM is required for its therapeutic effects.

Conclusions: Artesunate increases PICALM levels and Aβ clearance at the BBB which prevents development of Aβ pathology and functional deficits in mice and holds potential for translation to human AD."

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
# summary: Parkinson's disease (PD) causes motor dysfunction and dopaminergic cell death, with current treatments often leading to side effects. This study demonstrates that pretreating adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) with n-butylidenephthalide (BP), a compound with neuroprotective effects, enhances their therapeutic efficacy in a PD mouse model. Transplantation of BP-pretreated ADSCs improved motor symptoms and restored dopamine neuron levels, highlighting a promising strategy to enhance stem cell therapies for neurodegenerative diseases.
