abstract: "Circulating tumor cells (CTC) can be isolated via a minimally invasive blood draw and are considered a 'liquid biopsy' of their originating solid tumors. CTCs contain a small subset of metastatic precursors that can form metastases in secondary organs and provide a resource to identify mechanisms underlying metastasis-initiating properties. Despite technological advancements that allow for highly sensitive approaches of detection and isolation, CTCs are very rare and often present as single cells, posing an extreme challenge for ex vivo expansion after isolation. Here, using previously established patient-derived CTC lines, we performed a small-molecule drug screen to identify compounds that can improve ex vivo culture efficiency for single CTCs. We found that N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) and other antioxidants can promote ex vivo expansion of single CTCs, by reducing oxidative and other stress particularly at the initial stage of single-cell expansion. RNA-seq analysis of growing clones and nongrowing clones confirmed the effect by NAC, but also indicates that NAC-induced decrease in oxidative stress is insufficient for promoting proliferation of a subset of cells with predominant senescent features. Despite the challenge in expanding all CTCs, NAC treatment led to establishment of single CTC clones that have similar tumorigenic features. IMPLICATIONS: Through a small molecule screen and validation study, we found that NAC could improve the success of ex vivo expansion of single CTCs by mitigating the initial stress, with the potential to facilitate the investigation of functional heterogeneity in CTCs."
